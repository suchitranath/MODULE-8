#  EX.No:8(C) Hackerrank:Python Program to Find Students with the Second Lowest Grade

This program reads student names and their corresponding grades, identifies the **second lowest grade**, and prints the names of all students who have that grade in **alphabetical order**.


##  Aim

To write a Python program to:
- Read a list of students and their grades.
- Identify the second lowest grade.
- Print the names of students who have that grade, sorted alphabetically.


##  Algorithm

1. **Read** an integer `n` representing the number of students.
2. **Read** each studentâ€™s name and grade, and store them as a sublist inside a list.
3. **Extract** all the grades and sort them.
4. **Identify** the second lowest grade from the sorted grade list.
5. **Collect** names of all students whose grade matches the second lowest grade.
6. **Sort** the names alphabetically.
7. **Print** each name on a new line.


## Program
```
l1 = [] 
l2 = [] 

for _ in range(int(input())): 
    name = input() 
    score = float(input()) 
    l1.extend([name, score]) 
    l2.append(l1) 
    l1 = [] 

l3 = [] 
l4 = [] 

for i in l2: 
    l3.append(i[1]) 

l3 = sorted(list(set(l3)))  # Remove duplicates and sort

for i in l2: 
    if i[1] == l3[1]:  # Second lowest score
        l4.append(i[0]) 

l4.sort()  # Sort names alphabetically

for i in l4: 
    print(i)

```


## Output

## Result
Thus the python program for finding the students with second lowest grade has been implemented 
and executed successfully.
